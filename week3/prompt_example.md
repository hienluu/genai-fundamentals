### Context
I'm the VP of Product at a B2B SaaS company ($12M ARR, 80 employees).
We're planning our 2026 product roadmap and need to decide between
investing in AI features vs. improving our core platform reliability.


### Instructions
Analyze both investment options. Before giving your recommendation,
think through the trade-offs in <analysis> tags, considering:
- Market demand signals
- Engineering resource requirements
- Competitive pressure
- Impact on retention vs. acquisition

Then provide a clear recommendation with a proposed resource
allocation split.


### Constraints
- Be direct. I want your honest assessment, not a balanced "it depends."
- Use specific examples from B2B SaaS companies that faced similar decisions.
- Flag any assumptions you're making.
- Keep the total response under 600 words.
</constraints>

### Output format
- Analysis (in <analysis> tags)
- Recommendation (2-3 sentences)
- Proposed allocation: what percentage of engineering resources to each area, and why
