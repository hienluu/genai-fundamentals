## How to Humanize text

### Writing Techniques:
* Use conversational language - Write like you're talking to a friend rather than delivering a formal presentation. Include contractions (you're, don't, can't) and casual phrases.
* Add personal touches - Include personal anecdotes, opinions, or experiences. Use "I think," "in my experience," or "I've noticed" to create a personal voice.
* Vary sentence structure - Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones. Avoid repetitive patterns that sound robotic.
* Include imperfections - Real human writing isn't always perfect. Occasional run-on sentences, minor tangents, or colloquial expressions can make text feel more authentic.
* Use active voice - "I wrote the report" sounds more human than "The report was written by me."

### Content Strategies:
* Tell stories - Humans connect through narratives. Include examples, case studies, or brief stories to illustrate points.
* Show emotion - Express enthusiasm, concern, humor, or other feelings where appropriate. "I'm excited to share..." or "This really surprised me..."
* Ask questions - Engage readers directly with rhetorical questions or genuine inquiries about their experiences.
* Use humor appropriately - Light humor, wordplay, or gentle self-deprecation can make text more relatable.
* If You're Working with AI Content:
* Edit for flow - AI often writes in predictable patterns. Break these up by restructuring paragraphs and varying transitions.
* Add context - Include background information that a human would naturally provide based on their knowledge and experience.
*  Remove overly formal language - Replace stilted phrases with more natural alternatives.


### Steps

* Practical Approach to humanize report or book
* Save your text as markdown (.md) file (remove table of contents and internal targets)
* Step1 - use prompt1 to detect AI. Ask OpenAI o3 or Anthropic Claude to review it and tell if it was written by human or AI. And what are the signs that it might have been written by AI or if it was translated from another language
* Step2 - Create prompt2 (rewrite) - ask AI (OpenAI o3) to humanize the text and explicitly list in this prompt the signs of AI detected on previous stage. Ask it to output as .md file preserving original formatting
* Repeat Steps 1,2 one more time - it is usually enough to completely remove all signs of AI
* If you need to nicely format the output - drag it into Google Drive, open as GoogleDoc, format it as needed
